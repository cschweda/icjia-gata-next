Please join us for the 2019 Adult Redeploy Illinois & Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit, in Bloomington, May 14-15, 2019.

Hosted by Adult Redeploy Illinois, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority, and Loyola University’s Center for Criminal Justice Research, Policy, and Practice, the Summit will bring together multi-disciplinary team members from counties and judicial circuits operating or interested in developing CJCCs and ARI-funded local prison diversion programs. Serving as both the eighth annual ARI All-Sites Summit and the third convening of CJCCs from around the state, the event will provide rich opportunities for mutual learning and foster coordinated decision-making.

Day 1, the afternoon of Tuesday, May 14, will feature separate ARI and CJCC tracks focused on technical assistance and dialogue. There will be a networking reception following Tuesday’s program. Day 2, Wednesday, May 15, will be a full-day agenda exploring critical issues at the intersection of behavioral health and justice, including an inspiring keynote presentation and topical break-out sessions. The intended audience is a spectrum of ARI and CJCC site representatives including but not limited to judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, treatment providers, probation staff and supervisors, law enforcement, program coordinators, researchers, program partners, and policymakers.
