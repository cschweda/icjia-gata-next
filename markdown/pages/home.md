<!-- The Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) of 2014, 30 ILCS 708/1 et seq., increased accountability and transparency in the use of grant funds and reduced the administrative burden on state agencies and grantees through adoption of federal grant guidelines and regulations.

Pursuant to the Act, the Grant Accountability and Transparency Unit (GATU) was established within the Governor's Office of Management and Budget; GATU is charged with implementation of the Act in coordination with state grant-making agencies and nonprofit organizations in Illinois. GATA requires grants administered by state agencies to be awarded in a competitive bidding process. In addition, all applicants must undergo a registration and pre-award screening process. This competitive grant award process is initiated with a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).
