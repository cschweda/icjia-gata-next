ARI has grown from five initial pilot sites in early 2011, to the current 26 sites implementing about 50 programs covering 42 Illinois counties (as of March 2019).{.mb-5}\n","frontmatter":"title: 'About Adult Redeploy Illinois'\ntheme: 'light'\nalignment: 'left'\nlayout: 'map'\ntest:\n  - 'one'\n  - 'two'\nposted: '2019-01-29'","slug":"about-adult-redeploy-illinois","title":"About Adult Redeploy Illinois","theme":"light","alignment":"left","layout":"map","test":["one","two"],"posted":"2019-01-29"},{"body":"## MAY 14 & 15, 2019\n\n### DoubleTree by Hilton, Bloomington, Illinois{.muted .mt-3}\n\n### 10 Brickyard Drive{.muted}\n\n### Bloomington, IL 61701{.muted}\n","frontmatter":"title: 'The 2019 Adult Redeploy Illinois & Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit'\ntheme: 'light'\nalignment: 'center'\nlayout: 'full'\nposted: '2019-01-15'","slug":"home","title":"The 2019 Adult Redeploy Illinois & Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils Summit","theme":"light","alignment":"center","layout":"full","posted":"2019-01-15"},{"body":"Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils (CJCCs) are partnerships of decision makers who have a stake in the effective administration of justice. Typically the partnerships are organized at the county level and include representatives from:\n\n- The 3 branches of government (executive, judicial, and legislative)\n- Multiple levels of government (city, county, and state agencies)\n- Allied stakeholders from various other governmental entities, such as education or health and human services, community based organizations, service providers, and citizens.\n\nCJCCs follow a structured, data-driven planning process to identify, analyze, solve, and manage justice system issues. This work leads to better understanding of crime and criminal justice problems, greater cooperation among agencies and units of local government, clearer objectives and priorities, more effective resource allocation, and better quality criminal justice programs and personnel. Taken together, these results can increase public confidence in and support for criminal justice processes, enhancing system performance and, ultimately, the integrity of the law.\n","frontmatter":"title: 'About Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils'\ntheme: 'dark'\nalignment: 'left'\nlayout: 'full'\nposted: '2018-02-15'","slug":"about-criminal-justice-coordinating-councils","title":"About Criminal Justice Coordinating Councils","theme":"dark","alignment":"left","layout":"full","posted":"2018-02-15"}]
