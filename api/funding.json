Grants will be made with FY18 RSAT funds. A total of $700,000 in funding shall be made available to local government agencies for corrections-based or jail-based substance use disorder treatment or aftercare programs that meet the criteria detailed in the notice of funding opportunity for use over a period of 12 months.\n**Application deadline: October 31, 2019**\n\n## Program Requirements\n\nThis grant will fund programs in the following categories which are defined below.\n\n1. Corrections-based substance use disorder treatment\n2. Jail-based substance use disorder treatment\n3. Aftercare services\n\n### Corrections-based substance use disorder treatment\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Engage participants for a period between six and 12 months.\n- Provide residential treatment facilities set apart from the general correctional population. This can be a completely separate facility or dedicated housing unit in a facility exclusively for RSAT participants.\n- Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.\n- Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems.\n- Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.\n- Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication-assisted treatment.\n\nIf possible, RSAT participation should be limited to inmates with six to 12 months remaining in their confinement so they can be released from prison instead of returning to the general prison population after completing the program.\nProgram design must be based on effective, scientific practices.\n\n### Jail-based substance use disorder treatment\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Engage participants for at least three months.\n- Focus on the inmate’s substance use diagnosis and addiction-related needs.\n- Develop the inmate’s cognitive, behavioral, social, vocational, and other skills to solve the substance use and related problems with emphasis on the provision of cognitive-behavioral therapy.\n- Require urinalysis and/or other proven reliable forms of drug and alcohol testing for program participants, including both periodic and random testing, and for former participants while they remain in the custody of the state or local government.\n- Prepare participants for successful community reintegration, including post-release referral to appropriate evidence-based aftercare treatment and service providers that support the use of medication assisted treatment.\n- If possible, jail-based programs should separate the treatment population from the general correctional population and program design should be based on effective, scientific practices.\n\n### Aftercare Services\n\nSubstance use disorder treatment, established or implemented with assistance provided under RSAT, must provide aftercare services.\n\nPrograms must:\n\n- Involve coordination between the correctional treatment program, post-release supervision officer, and other social service and rehabilitation programs and services.\n- Work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.\n- Provide reentering individuals with comprehensive care coordination prior to and upon release from the facility. This includes a comprehensive reentry plan for aftercare services, other needs, and resources. It is most successfully accomplished when institution staff initiates linkages with aftercare agencies and services outside of the institution, including social services and/or treatment services, parole, and case management [1]. Continuity between prison and community can reduce re-offense rates [2].\n\nIn addition:\n\n- To qualify as an aftercare program, the head of the substance use disorder treatment program must work in conjunction with state and local authorities and organizations involved in substance use disorder treatment to assist in the placement of program participants into community substance use disorder treatment programs or services on release.\n\nEffective correctional and aftercare programming is most effective if they are **_structured, cognitive-behavioral, and skills-based._** Approaches such as Alcoholics Anonymous or faith/spiritual-based services do not meet the standard for correctional or treatment programs [3].\n\n1.

Grants will be made with VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT FFY 17 funds. A total of $ 800,000 in funding is available through this solicitation for use over a period of 12 months.\n\n**Application deadline: July 8,2019.**\n\nIn 2017, the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority was awarded a Linking Systems of Care for Children and Youth Demonstration grant from the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice [1]. The demonstration project seeks to address the needs of child and youth victims [2] and their families [3] by identifying young crime victims, coordinating prevention and intervention services post-victimization, and building capacity within communities to provide needed services and support.\n\nThe overarching vision for Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) is to alleviate the burden of finding services to address victimization by ensuring appropriate care and services are made available to all victims regardless of the door they first enter, whether it is a doctor’s office, school, or local police station or sheriff’s office.\n\n1. Illinois is one of four states designated as a demonstration site.\n2. We acknowledge that the term victim does not resonate with everyone who has experienced violence. Some prefer the term survivor or person impacted by violence. We encourage people and communities to use terms that best reflect their experiences.\n   Throughout this document we use the terms children and youth and young persons to refer to individuals from birth to 25 years of age.\n3. For reading ease, throughout this document we use the term family or family members to refer to the adults and other individuals who may live with and/or provide primary care for children and youth. These individuals or adults may include biological relatives (e.g., siblings, adults/uncles, grandparents, parents) and other caregivers (e.g., foster families, other non-relative adults).\n\n## Program Requirements\n\n- Strive to integrate the Illinois HEALS Mission, Values and Principles as outlined in this solicitation.\n- Implement the project goals as described in this solicitation and in the program narrative.\n- Hire and supervise the staff positions outlined in the program narrative.\n- Meet regularly with ICJIA Illinois HEALS staff to discuss implementation. These meetings will be both in person and via conference calls with a frequency collaboratively agreed upon between the coordinating Entity and Illinois HEALS staff.\n- Collaborate to share demonstration site progress for state and national audiences.\n- Develop evaluation plan in collaboration with ICJIA Research and Analysis Unit and participate in evaluation activities.\n- Complete quarterly reporting requirements.\n\n## Eligibility Information\n\nAgencies must be pre-qualified through the Grant Accountability and Transparency Act (GATA) Grantee Portal, https://grants.illinois.gov/portal/, to become eligible to apply for an award. Applicants must have completed the GATA pre-qualification process and received approval of their Internal Control Questionnaire (ICQ) by the period of performance start date, September 1, 2019 to be considered for funding.\n\nThe purpose of this pilot project is to test and document implementation of the Illinois HEALS Action Plan. The eligible applicant’s capacity is of the utmost importance. The Illinois HEALS team completed a methodical process to identify the eligible applicant from a pool of potential organizations. The eligible applicant was assessed on several criteria, including, but not limited to, ability to convene and maintain engagement of a broad array of community stakeholders, practitioners, and survivors, experience implementing a large community-wide planning processes, and experience managing grant funds. Based on this, the following eligible applicant was selected: **Egyptian Public and Mental Health Department**. There are additional eligibility criteria outlined in the NOFO.\n\n## Deadline\n\nCompleted application materials must be emailed to CJA.IllinoisHEALSDemo@illinois.gov by **11:59 p.m., July 8, 2019** to be considered for funding.

The demonstration project seeks to address the needs of child and youth victims [2] and their families [3] by identifying young crime victims, coordinating prevention and intervention services post-victimization, and building capacity within communities to provide needed services and support.</p><p>The overarching vision for Illinois HEALS (Helping Everyone Access Linked Systems) is to alleviate the burden of finding services to address victimization by ensuring appropriate care and services are made available to all victims regardless of the door they first enter, whether it is a doctor’s office, school, or local police station or sheriff’s office.</p><ol><li>Illinois is one of four states designated as a demonstration site.</li><li>We acknowledge that the term victim does not resonate with everyone who has experienced violence. Some prefer the term survivor or person impacted by violence. We encourage people and communities to use terms that best reflect their experiences.Throughout this document we use the terms children and youth and young persons to refer to individuals from birth to 25 years of age.</li><li>For reading ease, throughout this document we use the term family or family members to refer to the adults and other individuals who may live with and/or provide primary care for children and youth. These individuals or adults may include biological relatives (e.g., siblings, adults/uncles, grandparents, parents) and other caregivers (e.g., foster families, other non-relative adults).</li></ol><h2 id=\"program-requirements\">Program Requirements</h2><ul><li>Strive to integrate the Illinois HEALS Mission, Values and Principles as outlined in this solicitation.</li><li>Implement the project goals as described in this solicitation and in the program narrative.</li><li>Hire and supervise the staff positions outlined in the program narrative.</li><li>Meet regularly with ICJIA Illinois HEALS staff to discuss implementation.
